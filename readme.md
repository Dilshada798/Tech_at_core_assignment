# About Problem:-
In this statement we have to make a new booking system for meetings.

# Problem statement:-
1. In  this program firstly we took the number of employees those wants to schedule the meeting.Then our loop iterates till the number of employees entry.
2. submission_time_of_employee is taken to show the request  for scheduling a meeting is made 
3. employee_id is taken for giving id of the employees.
4. meeting_start_time:in this the starting time of the meeting slot.
duration:in this the duration of the meeting is taken.


Firstly we have to arrange the request in ascending order as the request made first should  be addressed.

then we start scheduling the meeting according to the requests made.Further if the  time overlaps it gaves the respective message.
